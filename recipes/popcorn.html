    <p>A lunch that is known to be perfect with a good movie</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup high quality popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or more to taste</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a 3-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat. 
            If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.</li>
        <li>Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil and Wait for the popcorn kernels to pop.</li>
        <li>When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer</li>
        <li>Cover the pot, remove from heat and count 30 seconds, waiting 30 seconds brings all of the 
            other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, 
            they all pop at about the same time</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the heat,Once the popping starts in earnest, 
            gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner</li>
        <li>Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, 
            remove the pan from the heat and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the empty hot pan, after the butter melt drizzle the melted butter over the popcorn and toss to distribute</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the popcorn with salt to taste</li>
    </ol>
