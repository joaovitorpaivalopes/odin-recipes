    <p>A simple and tasty snack</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop the chocolate and scrape it into a bowl</li>
        <li>Pour the cream into a saucepan. 
            Over medium low heat, warm the cream just until hot 
            and beginning to simmer around the edges. 
            Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate.
        Let it sit for 3 minutes,
        then stir until it smooths out into a creamy ganache.</li>
        <li>Let the ganache cool at room temperature for 1 hour, 
            then cover and refrigerate until firm enough to scoop into balls, 
            at least 2 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Use a small cookie scoop with a release lever (about 1 tablespoon) 
            to scoop the ganache into 2 dozen balls. Freeze the scooped balls for 10 minutes, 
            then roll them smooth between your hands.</li>
        <li>Place the cocoa powder in a bowl, and 
            roll the chilled ganache in the cocoa powder and done.</li>
        <li>You must place your finished truffles in an airtight container
            to be able to store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or in the frezer for up to 3-6 months
        </li>
    </ol>
